# Cally
Cally is a lightweight, immutable registry for storing and retrieving data or services in PHP. It provides a simple yet powerful way to manage configurations, dependencies, or any key-value pairs with support for immutability and PSR-11 compliance. Cally is ideal for any project where a heavy dependency injection container is unnecessary.
